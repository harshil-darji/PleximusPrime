## üîê VPN Configuration:
The PleximusPrime setup works seamlessly with Mullvad VPN, but you can configure it for other VPN providers as well. Create an `.env` file and follow these steps to configure the VPN:

1. Get Your VPN Account: 
- For Mullvad, visit [Mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net/). For other VPNs, follow their respective account setup and configuration instructions.
- If using WireGuard, generate your private key and server location from your VPN provider. OpenVPN can also be configured but WireGuard offers better performance and speed due to its lightweight design and modern cryptography.

2. Download the VPN Configuration:
- For Mullvad, download the WireGuard or OpenVPN configuration.
- For other VPN providers, retrieve your configuration settings and connection details.

3. Set the Configuration details to the .env:

```bash
WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vpn_private_key_here
WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES=your_vpn_addresses # Example: 10.x.x.x/32
SERVER_CITIES=city_name  # Example: Amsterdam
SERVER_COUNTRIES=country_name  # Example: Netherlands
```

4. Test the VPN Connection:

Run the container and check the logs to verify that your VPN is connected properly. If the VPN is configured correctly, your Plex server‚Äôs traffic will be routed securely through the VPN, ensuring a private and secure streaming experience:

```bash
docker logs gluetun
```
